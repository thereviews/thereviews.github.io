If you want to stream your PlayStation games remotely, you’ve probably heard of Chiaki and PlayStation Portal. Both let you play PS4/PS5 games without a traditional TV setup, but they work very differently. Here’s a simple breakdown to help you choose the best option.

## 🎮 What Is Chiaki?

Some handheld devices


It doesn’t require a Sony subscription and usually offers more device flexibility and customization.

#@ 🎮 What Is PlayStation Portal?

PlayStation Portal is Sony’s official handheld device only for remote play. It streams your PS5 to its built-in screen — you can’t install games on it, you can’t cloud game, and it must always connect to your PS5.

 ### Pros

Official, simple setup

DualSense features built in (adaptive triggers, haptics)

Great screen quality


### Cons

Works only with PS5

Doesn’t support cloud gaming

Limited updates and closed ecosystem

Expensive for what it does ($199+)

## 💡 Final Tip

No matter which you choose, your network/router matters more than the app. A slow network = lag, even on official devices.
