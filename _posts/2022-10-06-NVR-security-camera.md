### How to Choose the Best NVR Camera System for Home

When selecting an NVR security camera system, consider these key factors:

#### 1. Resolution & Image Quality

4K (Ultra HD): Best for identifying faces and license plates.

2K / 1080p: Great for general surveillance at a lower cost.

Night Vision: Look for infrared (IR) or color night vision for 24/7 monitoring.


#### 2. Number of Channels (Camera Support)

4-Channel: Small homes or apartments.

8-Channel: Medium-sized homes.

16-Channel+: Large homes or businesses.


#### 3. Storage & Recording

Local Storage: Built-in HDD (1TB, 2TB, etc.).

Cloud Storage: Subscription-based for remote access and backup.

Continuous vs. Motion-Triggered Recording: Saves storage by recording only when motion is detected.


#### 4. Smart Features & Remote Access

Mobile Apps: Check live footage from anywhere.

AI Detection: Human, vehicle, and pet detection.

Two-Way Audio: Talk to visitors remotely.


#### 5. Power Source & Connectivity

PoE (Power over Ethernet): Stable and reliable, single cable for power and data.

Wireless: Easier installation but may have Wi-Fi interference.

Battery-Powered: Best for areas without wired connections.


#### 6. Weatherproof & Build Quality

Outdoor-rated cameras should be IP65/IP66/IP67-rated for weather resistance.

Vandal-proof casings help prevent tampering.
